			<h1>About Me</h1>
			<p>I'm a UI/UX Designer, living in San Francisco. I became interested in Front-End Web Design and Development because it is a skill that most UI/UX designers have acquired, and is something that will be highly beneficial in the kickstart of my new career.</p>
			<h3>My Mission</h3>
			<p>As I learn more about front-end, along with other    programming languages, I hope to one day develop my own apps similar to Lisa Bettany's <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/camera+/id329670577?mt=8">Camera+</a>. Being the passionate photographer that I am, I would like to work in an environment where I would be able to develop software that helps transform images into works of art.</p>

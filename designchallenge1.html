	<h1>Design Challenge #1</h1>
	<h2>Which two websites are you most inspired by?</h2>
	<p> I was most inspired by <a href="http://www.dtelepathy.com">Digital Telepathy</a> and <a href="http://wwww.digitalforallnow.com">Digital For All Now</a>. I think both sites are designed incredibly well considering their audiences and goals.</p>
	<h2>How do they exhibit effective use of space, size or balance?</h2>
	<h3>Huge Inc.</h3>

	<p>Digital Telepathy starts with a large intro video and bold headline placed in the header and makes for a beautifully crafted focal point attracting the viewer's eyes. The body of the site is vertically balanced and symmetrically spaced, utilizing more negative than positive space. The web design also includes large icons, hyperlink hover color change, and vertical parallax scrolling to increase user engagement.</p>
	<h3>Digital For All Now</h3>

	<p>Digital For All Now, a European provider of business to business digital services, created an interactive and animated site using mini games and large flat illustrations to establish visual interest. The focal point for each column of the home page includes a large bold statement to take action, break obstacles, speed up digital progress in hospitals, etc. As you vertically scroll down the page, you will notice the design is well-balanced in size with each column sharing a similar theme; one focal point, large flat primitive animations and a mini game. </p>
	<h2>What makes them similar and different?</h2>
	<p>Both sites use the wildly popular aesthetic trend of flat design to embrace the limits of your screen with simplicity and minimalism. Each site contains vertically aligned columns with centered focal points. They also use a fair amount of negative space to enhance usability and user experience. The main difference with these two sites would be that Digital Telepathy engages its users with a video introduction while Digital For All Now uses mini-games.</p>
	<h2>Thumbnail Sketches & Process</h2>
	<h3>Digital Telepathy</h3>

	<p><ul>
	<li>The <strong>focal point</strong> of Huge's page is on the large headline, depicted by the large squiggly lines in the <em>sketch</em>, the "Heading" placeholder text in the <em>wireframe</em>, and the "Meh. Tuesday." text in the <em>screenshot</em>.</li>
	<li>The <strong>hiarchy</strong> and <strong>flow</strong> of Huge's page starts at the main headline, but then moves downward towards the content, represented by the four large graphic elements at the bottom of the page.</li>
	<li>The <strong>balance</strong> on Huge's website is symmetrical, which gives equal focus on the content being displayed. The four elements at the bottom are centered and equally sized and spaced. The main headline, the largest element on the screen, is centered.</li></p></ul>  
	<h3>Digital For All Now</h3>

	<p><ul>
	<li>Pitchfork's page mostly lacks a clear <strong>focal point</strong>. If anything, your eyes are drawn to their name, "Pitchfork" at the top of the page, illustrated as an image placeholder in both the <em>sketch</em> and <em>wireframe</em>, with their main text logo in its place in the <em>screenshot</em>.</li>
	<li><strong>Hiarchy</strong> is represented in a few different ways on Pitchfork's website. The top of the page gives you a main or global navigation bar, as well as a sub-nav bar below it. Underneath the navigation, you're given two key areas to explore, their top articles or recent album reviews.
	<li>The <strong>balance</strong> on Huge's website is asymmetrical, giving more emphasis on the large album review section, taking up almost two-thirds of the page.</li></p></ul>

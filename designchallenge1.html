	<h1>Design Challenge #1</h1>
	<h2>Which two websites are you most inspired by?</h2>
	<p> I was most inspired by <a href="http://www.dtelepathy.com">Digital Telepathy</a> and <a href="http://wwww.digitalforallnow.com">Digital For All Now</a> </p>
	<h2>How do they exhibit effective use of space, size or balance?</h2>
	<h3>Digital Telepathy</h3>
	<img src="Digital Telepathy Screen Shot.png" height="280" width="420"> 
	<p>Digital Telepathy starts with a large intro video and bold headline placed in the header and makes for a beautifully crafted focal point attracting the viewer's eyes. The body of the site is vertically balanced and symmetrically spaced, utilizing more negative than positive space. The web design also includes large icons, hyperlink hover color change, and vertical parallax scrolling to increase user engagement.</p>
	<h3>Digital For All Now</h3>
	<img src="Digital For All Now Screen Shot.png" height="280" width="420">
	<p>Digital For All Now, a European provider of business to business digital services, created an interactive and animated site using mini games and large flat illustrations to establish visual interest. The focal point for each column of the home page includes a large bold statement to take action, break obstacles, speed up digital progress in hospitals, etc. As you vertically scroll down the page, you will notice the design is well-balanced in size with each column sharing a similar theme; one focal point, large flat primitive animations and a mini game. </p>
	<h2>What makes them similar and different?</h2>
	<p>Both sites use the wildly popular aesthetic trend of flat design to embrace the limits of your screen with simplicity and minimalism. Each site contains vertically aligned columns with centered focal points. They also use a fair amount of negative space to enhance usability and user experience. The main difference with these two sites would be that Digital Telepathy engages its users with a video introduction while Digital For All Now uses mini-games.</p>
